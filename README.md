This repository implements the code for the paper [Learning to Fly: Computational Controller Design for Hybrid UAVs with Reinforcement Learning](http://people.csail.mit.edu/jiex/papers/LearningToFly/index.html) (**SIGGRAPH 2019**).



### Code Structure

- `SimulationUI`: C++ rigid body simulation to visualize the controller's performance. (C++)
- `Training`: Code to train the controller with our method with Reinforcement Learning. (Python)
- `Firmware`: Modified Ardupilot firmware code to implement our controller on real hardware. (C++)



### Simulation UI

- The code is implemented to visualize the controller's performance in a realistic simulation environment and provide the user interaction to control the hybrid UAV through keyboard.

- The code has been tested on `Ubuntu 16.04` and `Ubuntu 18.04`.

- Compiling the code relies on `cmake >= 3.1.0`. Please install it through the instruction in this [link](https://cmake.org/install/) before compiling the code.

- Compile the code:

  - Enter `SimulationUI` folder.

  - Create build folder and enter it by:

    ```
    mkdir build; cd build;
    ```

  - Run cmake and make to compile the code.

    ```
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../
    make -j4
    ```

  - If cmake fails, please install the missing libraries listed in the error message.

- Run the code:

  - The default code will run the simulation for QuadPlane controlled by a pre-trained neural network controller.

  - Run the following command inside the `build` folder:

    ```
    ./projects/design_viewer/design_viewer
    ```

  - It will open a window as below where you can control the hybrid UAV through keyboard commands.

- Keyboard Command:

  - We provide a bunch of keyboard command to allow you to easily control the hybrid UAV.
  - `p`: start/pause simulation, you need to press `p` after you create the window.
  - `w/s`: increase/decrease velocity z (vertical velocity, negative value is going up).
  - `a/d`: increase/decrease target yaw angle.
  - `up/down`: increase/decrease velocity x (forward velocity).
  - `left/right`: increase/decrease velocity y (side velocity).
  - You can use the mouse scroll wheel to zoom in/out (scroll) and change the view (press and move) of the camera.
  - For more keyboard operation, please refer to the code.
  - To be noted, there is a dead zone for the velocity z, thus the controller is not triggered until the velocity z is smaller than -0.5.

- Tail-sitter: we also provide the config file and the pretrained controller for tail-sitter. You can modify the code in `DesignViewer.cpp` to load its config file and replace the controller parameter file  `projects/copter_simulation/Controller/NN/NNModelParameters.h` with its controller file (which you can find in `projects/copter_simulation/Controller/NN/TailSitter/`).



### Training

- The code has been tested on `Ubuntu 16.04`.

- The code relies on a modified version of OpenAI baselines in `git@github.com:eanswer/openai_baselines.git`. To run the code, please first clone the repository

  ```
  git clone git@github.com:eanswer/openai_baselines.git
  ```

  and then follow the `README.md` to install baselines.

- We provide two models in the data folder.

- To start training a controller for a model, for example QuadPlane, in one thread,

  ```
  python run.py --model QuadPlane
  ```

  or in multiple threads (e.g. 4),

  ```
  mpirun -np 4 python run.py --model QuadPlane
  ```

  You can also add a `--visualize` to visualize the training by `Mujoco`. (If you don't install `Mujoco`, this option does't work).

- The trained models are saved in `results` folder.

- To test a trained mode, for example model_afterIter_400.ckpt, you can run

  ```
  python run.py --model QuadPlane --controller model_afterIter_400 --play
  ```

- To save a trained model to a `c++` format to be plugged into the `SimulationUI` code or `ardupilot` firmware code.

  ```
  python save.py --controller model_afterIter_400
  ```



### Firmware Deployment

- The firmware code is based on the Ardupilot codebase and tested in Pixhawk 1.0.

- First plug the model description file generated by training code (should named `AP_MotorsPolicyDefinition.h`) into the firmware codebase:

  ```
  cp AP_MotorsPolicyDefinition.h ../../Firmware/ardupilot/libraries/AP_Motors/
  ```

- Connect the Pixhawk 1.0 to your computer by usb cabel.

- Enter the folder `ArduCopter` by `cd Firmware/ardupilot/ArduCopter`.

- Compile and upload the firmware code by

  ```
  make px4-v2-upload
  ```


- Please refer to Ardupilot [official document](https://ardupilot.org/copter/index.html) for more detials.

### Docker

- Use the provided Dockerfile

```
docker build -t learning_to_fly .
```

- Launch a container with graphics enabled. E.g.,

```
docker run -it  \
       --env="DISPLAY" \
       --env="QT_X11_NO_MITSHM=1" \
       --volume="/tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:rw" \
       --net="host" \
       --privileged \
       --volume $(pwd):/usr/src/app \
       learning_to_fly \
       /bin/bash
```

- In the container, the code has been deployed and built in /code/
- You can also use the container for development by working on the /usr/src/app directory.

#### Testing the image
 - Train from scratch
 ```
 cd /code/LearningToFly/Training/code
 python3 run.py  --model rama
 ```
 - Export the policy
 ```
python3 save.py --controller best_model
cp AP_MotorsPolicyDefinition_UI.h ../../SimulationUI/projects/copter_simulation/Controller/NN/NNModelParameters.h
 ```
 - Re-compile design viewer
 ```
 cd /code/LearningToFly/SimulationUI/build
 make -j4
 ```
 - Launch the simulator with the trained policy
 ```
 cd /code/LearningToFly/SimulationUI/build
 ./projects/design_viewer/design_viewer
 ```
